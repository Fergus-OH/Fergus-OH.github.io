# About me

sample text

---

*I have always been fascinated by how mathematics can be used to model the world around us. During my first couple of years in university, I developed an appreciation for topics that ranged across a wide variety of mathematics. This motivated me to pursue joint honours in the two subjects for my degree, which allowed me to gain a diverse range of skills and insights that ultimately provided the opportunity to pinpoint my passion: machine learning.

With this sparked interest, I tailored the courses in my master's to areas that are mathematically foundational to machine learning. Throughout these studies, I completed a couple of independent mini-projects, which allowed me to explore the forefront of deep learning research and implement, simulate, and adapt PyTorch code from research papers.*
